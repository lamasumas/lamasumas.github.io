				My name is Eduardo Lamas Suárez, I'm a Software Engineer that studied his degree at Oviedo's University. Currently, I work as a JAVA programmer analyst in Merkle where I'm part of a team that focus on mantaining a legacy project, while implementing new features in both front-end and back-end.
			<br>
		
				Apart from my Spanish, in which I have a native level, I'm able to speak a fluent English and French at a fundamental level .

			</p>
			<p>

				In 2019, I was living in Ireland, where I lived and studied for a year. Later that same year, during Summer, I took my first job, as an full-stack developer in the CIT (Cork Institute of Technology) university, where I was developing two online tools and a <a href="http://www.ecco-oss.eu/" target="_blank">web page</a> for the INTERREG ECCO project (the three projects are in my github account). This online tool is currently online <a href="http://www.eccoghgtool.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, in 2014 I studied in the Lycée René Jodué Valin, located in France, where I was staying for half a year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among other things, my hobbies are doing karate, going to the gym, reading books, taking part in hackathons (I won the first CIT hackathon) and improving my programming skills.
