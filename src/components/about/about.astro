          Hi! I'm Eduardo Lamas Suárez, a Full Stack Software Engineer from
          Spain, currently based in Tokyo. Over the years, I've had the chance
          to live and work in Spain, Ireland, Switzerland, and Japan, and
          contribute to projects at <strong>CERN</strong> and the European initiative
          <strong>ECCO</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm working at <strong>Tap.co.jp</strong> as a Fullstack Engineer,
          building web applications using <strong>Java Spring</strong> and
          <strong>Angular with TypeScript</strong>. I enjoy creating useful and
          creative applications, experimenting with new technologies, and
          learning by building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love photography, long city photo walks, going to
          the gym, and taking part in hackathons (I even won my first one at
          CIT). I also speak fluent English, basic French, and basic Japanese —
          which I started learning during the COVID lockdown while working at
          Merkle as a Java programmer analyst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always happy to connect — feel free to say hi or reach out if you have
          a project in mind!
